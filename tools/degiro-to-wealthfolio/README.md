# DeGiro → Wealthfolio CSV converter

Convert DeGiro `Account.csv` (full ledger) to a CSV that imports cleanly into
the Wealthfolio HA add-on.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
node convert.mjs /path/to/Account.csv -o wealthfolio.csv
```

In Wealthfolio: **Activities → Import → Upload `wealthfolio.csv`**. The
column headers match Wealthfolio's defaults, so the mapping step is a
no-op — confirm, review the resolved ISINs, save the import template for
re-use on next month's export.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Asserts against `fixtures/degiro-sample.csv`.

## Supported locales

- Dutch (NL) — primary
- English (EN) — works
- German / French / Italian / Spanish / Portuguese / Czech — extend
  `LOCALES` in `convert.mjs` (header signature + keyword tables for
  `buyPrefix`, `sellPrefix`, `dividend`, `dividendTax`, `fee`, `fx`,
  `deposit`, `withdrawal`, `cashSweep`).

## What it does

- Detects locale from the first header column (`Datum` → NL, `Date` → EN).
- Groups rows by `Order Id`. A typical buy ships as 4 rows (asset trade,
  FX debit, FX credit, transaction fee) — folded into a single Wealthfolio
  BUY row with `fee` summed in.
- Standalone rows (no Order Id) are classified as DIVIDEND (incl. capital
  distributions / `Kapitaalsuitkering`), TAX (dividend withholding,
  Belgian transaction tax / `Transactiebelasting België`, Dutch VAT /
  `B.T.W.`), INTEREST (`Flatex Interest [Income]`,
  `Inkomsten uit Securities Lending`), DEPOSIT (`iDEAL Deposit/storting`,
  `Sofort Deposit`, `flatex Deposit`), WITHDRAWAL, or FEE
  (connection/exchange, `ADR/GDR Externe Kosten`, `Service-fee`,
  `Trustly/Sofort Storting Kosten`).
- Trade-group rows (those sharing an Order Id with a BUY/SELL) emit the
  asset trade plus a separate TAX row for any embedded transaction-tax
  charge (e.g. Belgian TOB attached to an Amazon purchase).
- `WIJZIGING ISIN: Koop/Verkoop N @ X CCY` rows (DeGiro corporate-action
  ISIN re-issuance) emit as real BUY/SELL trades. **Orphan SELLs**
  (intermediate ISINs with no prior position in the export) are dropped
  to avoid Wealthfolio rejecting the import; balanced same-ISIN pairs are
  preserved.
- Both `iDEAL Deposit` / `iDEAL storting` (real money entering DeGiro from
  your bank) and `Overboeking naar uw geldrekening bij flatexDEGIRO Bank`
  (cash being swept into your flatex savings account, with or without the
  `SE` suffix) are mapped to **DEPOSIT**. The `Overboeking van` direction
  (cash returning from flatex to trading) is intentionally not classified
  — it represents internal money flow, not a real outflow. **Caveat:**
  this can double-count the same money when DeGiro auto-sweeps a fresh
  iDEAL deposit to flatex moments later. Filter accordingly if your
  Wealthfolio account models flatex+trading as one combined wallet.
- Filters out FLATEX cash-sweep rows (`ISIN = NLFLATEXACNT`).
- Skips `PRODUCTWIJZIGING` (product-change) rows — they're ISIN remaps with
  zero cash effect, not real trades.
- Drops FX legs (`Valuta Creditering` / `Valuta Debitering`) — Wealthfolio
  doesn't model FX conversions; only the asset-currency leg of the trade
  is kept.
- Tolerates DeGiro's mixed comma/period decimal style (`-33,90` and
  `-97.93` both appear in real exports).
- **Resolves ISIN → ticker via OpenFIGI** so the `symbol` column is
  populated (otherwise Wealthfolio flags every trade in the asset-review
  step). Results cached at `~/.cache/degiro-to-wealthfolio/figi.json` so
  repeat runs don't re-query. Pass `--no-figi` to skip the lookup. ISINs
  are sent to `api.openfigi.com` over HTTPS.

## Limitations

- Only Account.csv is supported (the cash-and-trades ledger). Transactions.csv
  is incomplete (no dividends/fees/deposits) so it's not worth the second
  code path.
- DE/FR/IT/etc. locales: untested. The `LOCALES` table is the only place
  to add them.
- FX conversion legs are discarded. Fine for portfolio tracking, lossy for
  exact cash-balance reconciliation.
- OpenFIGI returns the composite/primary listing's ticker. For Irish
  ETFs (VWRL, etc.), that's often the German Xetra ticker (VGWL) rather
  than the Amsterdam ticker. Wealthfolio's resolver handles the suffix
  step on its own, but you may need to confirm the asset in the
  asset-review step.
